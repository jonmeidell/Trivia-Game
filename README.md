# Trivia-Game

An X-men themed timed trivia game.

You're on the clock!  Answer all of these questions before time runs out!

Each question has a 10 second time limit, and will pause for 4 seconds to let the player see what the correct answer is.

Few minor fixes that need to be done:
  1 - have questions display in a random order
  2 - add more questions
  3 - show if you answered "correct" or "incorrect"
  4 - finish functionality to keep track of timer runout on questions and prompt the player that they "ran out of time"
  5 - make buttons and layout look better:
      - make layout sit move centered vertically
