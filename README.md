# Trivia-Game

#### Welcome to my X-Men themed timed trivia game.
</div>

You are on the clock!  Answer all of the questions before time runs out!  Each question has a 10 second time limit, and will pause for 4 seconds to let the player see what the correct answer is.

Few minor fixes that need to be done:
  * _have questions display in a random order_
  * _add more questions_
  * _show if you answered "correct" or "incorrect"_
  * _finish functionality to keep track of timer runout on questions and prompt the player that they "ran out of time"_
  * _get rid of a few Javascript bugs regarding game restarting and questions/time/picture not displaying correctly_
